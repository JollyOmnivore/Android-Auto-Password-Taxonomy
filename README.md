## Motivation
- I created this app out of a need; my mom has been using a method to create her passwords which would vary from company to company based on the name. 
- This app serves to simplify that process by using a built-in "algorithm" to generate passwords.
- This app aims to prevent attacks that are done on mass where hackers use leaked passwords from one company to get into your account for another.
- Additionally, hackers often buy personal data in bulk, so even if you change some part of the password based on the company name, certain algorithms can figure that out and exploit it.
- Modifying the date of birth to generate consistent numbers will help throw off brute-force attempts that use personal data.


## Features
- Easy-to-use password creator
- Password saving in the "Password Vault" (Locally saved SQLite Database)
- Ability to add newly generated passwords to the clipboard
- Ability to add previously vaulted passwords to the clipboard
- Password sorting in the vault by recent and alphabetical descending order


## Android Tech Used

- Utilizes multiple pages
- Implements a date picker fragment
- Uses an SQLite database
- SQLite database stores company names and associated passwords
- Uses Clipboard Manager service
- Uses intents to pass information between activities
- Form data is not destroyed while using the app
- Uses coroutines to manage database insertion

## Running Locally

- To run this app locally, you must have Android Studio since it is not on the Play Store yet.
- Additionally, you must have a device running API 30 or above.
- In your Gradle configuration, your target SDK must be at least version 34.
